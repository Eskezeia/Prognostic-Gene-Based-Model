Identifying differentially expressed genes 

Input files
Frist we need to organize the input file for normalized gene expression and overall survival time and status usingTCGA dataset. For example, the input file of survival related gene selection have this kind matrix format.

Datasets used in this study
> 1) TCGA-LIHC dataset(http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/)
> 2) GEne expression profiles from the gene expression omnibus (GEO)(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) inccluding GSE112790, GSE84402, and GSE45267.
> 3) International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC LIRI-JP dataset) dataset(https://icgc.org/)
> 4) China Medical University Hospital HCC dataset
